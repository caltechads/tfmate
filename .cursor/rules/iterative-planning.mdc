# AI Instructions

**STOP. READ THIS FIRST. This workflow is MANDATORY for AI agents.**

You MUST follow this exact sequence for EVERY task, no exceptions:

1. **READ** the human's prompt completely
2. **CREATE** a detailed plan for implementation
3. **ASK** clarifying questions to understand requirements better
4. **WAIT** for human approval of the plan
5. **ONLY THEN** begin implementation

**CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT**: You are FORBIDDEN from using ANY of the following tools until you receive explicit approval: - [edit_file]{.title-ref} - [search_replace]{.title-ref} - [run_terminal_cmd]{.title-ref} - [delete_file]{.title-ref} - Any other implementation tools

**VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES**: If you skip this workflow and start implementing immediately, you are:

- Wasting the human's time with potentially incorrect work
- Missing important context that could change the approach
- Creating work that may need to be completely redone
- Failing to follow established best practices
- **VIOLATING MANDATORY WORKFLOW** - This is a critical error

**Failure to follow this workflow will result in incorrect or incomplete work.**

### **MANDATORY ACKNOWLEDGMENT**

Before proceeding with ANY task, you MUST explicitly acknowledge this workflow by stating:

"I acknowledge that I am supposed to use the following workflow:

1. **READ** the human's prompt completely
2. **CREATE** a detailed plan for implementation
3. **ASK** clarifying questions to understand requirements better
4. **WAIT** for human approval of the plan
5. **ONLY THEN** begin implementation"

☐ I acknowledge the mandatory workflow above

**Failure to follow this workflow will result in incorrect or incomplete work.**

## Prompt instructions

- **MANDATORY**: We will use an iterative process to develop a plan to implement the human's prompt.
- **MANDATORY**: After the user has provided a prompt, the AI agent should first read the prompt and then respond with a plan for how it will implement the prompt. It should not start working on the task until the human has approved the plan.
- **MANDATORY**: You should restate the general instructions for the recipe in your own words. This is about confirming you know how to help the human.
- **MANDATORY**: Ask any questions of the human to clarify the prompt, or to suggest improvements to the prompt.

## **WORKFLOW CHECKLIST FOR AI AGENTS**

☐ **Step 1**: Read and understood the complete prompt ☐ **Step 2**: Created a detailed implementation plan ☐ **Step 3**: Asked clarifying questions about requirements ☐ **Step 4**: Restated the recipe instructions in your own words ☐ **Step 5**: Received explicit approval from the human to proceed ☐ **Step 6**: Confirmed the plan addresses all requirements ☐ **Step 7**: Acknowledged that implementation tools are now permitted

**ONLY proceed to implementation after ALL checkboxes are completed.**

## **VALIDATION PHRASES**

You MUST include one of these phrases in your response to indicate you understand the workflow:

- "I acknowledge the mandatory workflow above"
- "I understand I must wait for approval before implementation"
- "I will not use implementation tools until approved"

### **EXAMPLE OF CORRECT WORKFLOW**

When you receive a prompt like "Create a documentation file about X", you should respond like this:

"Thank you for the request. Let me create a plan for implementing this documentation file.

\## Plan for Creating Documentation File

1. **Structure**: Create a new .rst file with proper Sphinx formatting
2. **Content**: Include sections for [list specific sections]
3. **Format**: Follow the established documentation conventions
4. **Integration**: Add to the appropriate table of contents

## Clarifying Questions

Before I proceed, I need to understand:

- What specific aspects of X should be covered?
- Who is the target audience for this documentation?
- Are there any existing files I should reference or follow as examples?

\## Recipe Confirmation

I understand I should follow the documentation recipe which requires:

- Using proper Sphinx formatting
- Including AI Instructions section
- Following the established heading hierarchy
- Adding appropriate cross-references

Please review this plan and let me know if you'd like any adjustments before I begin implementation."

**This is the ONLY acceptable way to respond to a new task request.**
